Subscript-broadcast model
	Players and rockets subscribe to grids
		Players and rockets broadcast and receive messages within subscribed grids

Each player has their own AOI of square length X
	If AOI intersects with more than 1 grid
		Subscribe to those grids

Whenever a grid receives a new subscription
	Broadcast new object to every player in grid

Each grid contains an array of ship ID and rocket ID

For each grid
	For each bullet
		For each player
			Check if hit

Players only render object within their AOI
	Even though they may receive broadcast from players outside of their AOI


Because pid = increasing integer.

To broadcast updates, broadcast within grid only
	Get ship ID from grid
	Use ship ID to get socket ID


broadcastWithinGrid {
	for all players in grid
		get player.pid
		get socket[player.pid] to get socket connection

		broadcast this message to this connection
}
